I am a senior undergraduate majoring in [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.eeb.uconn.edu)
at the [University of Connecticut (UConn)](https://www.uconn.edu). 
Once I graduate, I will continue with a Master's degree in Biodiversity and Conservation at UConn. 
I have had previous work experience in the [Wagner lab](https://hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/people/dwagner/) with lepidopteran systematics and
specimen archival and preparation. My undergraduate Honors thesis is focused on identifying
and DNA barcoding caterpillar parasitoids and their hosts. My future plans include field research
projects in the [Knutie lab](https://www.knutielab.com/). Hobbies include gardening, reading, and dabbling in 
traditional art.
