I am an undergraduate [University Scholar](https://universityscholars.uconn.edu/2020-university-scholars/) 
in the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.eeb.uconn.edu)
at the [University of Connecticut](https://www.uconn.edu).

I am investigating the gut microbiomes of closely related cicada species and their hybrids. 
Specifically, I am interested in using metagenomic methods to characterize differences in 
gut microbiomes and to see if these differences correlate with habitat shifts in the hybrids.
