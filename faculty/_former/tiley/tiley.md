### About me

I am currently a PostDoc in the Yoder Lab (Integrative Evolutionary Genetics in the Service of Conserving Biodiversity)

My research interests include: Molecular Evolution, Computational Phylogenetics, Biodiversity in Madagascar, Comparative
Genomics, Gene Duplication and Loss

Most recently, I've been working on identifying model misspecification in phylogenetics and measuring how empirical levels of model misspecification affect estimation of gene tree discordance and species trees. I'm mostly focused on lemurs right now, but still work on contentious phylogenetic relationships and molecular evolution in plants, birds, and insects. I also use genomic data to test demographic hypotheses that are relevant to Madagascar's natural history and biogeography.
