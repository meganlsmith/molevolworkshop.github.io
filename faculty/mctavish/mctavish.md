### Open Tree of Life

{% include figure.html description="OpenTree" url="/faculty/mctavish/img/Opentree.png" css="image-right" height="350px" %}
The Open Tree of Life project synthesizes scientific knowledge about the phylogeny of all life. 
Open Tree has constructed a comprehensive, dynamic, and digitally-available tree of life across
2.5 million taxa by bringing together published phylogenetic trees and taxonomic data.

It's available at tree.opentreeoflife.org

Upload your trees to tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator to have them included in this synthetic estimate of evolutionary relationships across life on earth!

[Here is a tutorial](https://mctavishlab.github.io/BIO144/labs/rotl-rgbif.html) about how to automate pulling down trees for any set of species you are interested in:

Feel free to ask me any questions about Open Tree or these tutorials!
